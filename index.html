      <p class="second-text">Lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of the type
        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the <br> release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
